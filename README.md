Energy for an earthquake event (origin: 2022 05 26 12:02; lat long dep: -14.89 -70.20 252.00km; ), shown as Fâ€“ amplitude and displayed in terms of slowness and time and back-azimuth (relative to the great-circle path) and time. Pink circles denote theoretical arrivals of pP, sP, & PP. Significant energy on the great circle path between pP and PP.
